This file records significant dsh-qqbot updates from a product perspective, focusing on user-visible changes.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- **Image understanding**: send images to the bot and it will automatically understand their content (screenshots, photos, charts, etc.), and can analyze them together with text instructions.
- **File sending**: the bot can send local files (documents, images, etc.) directly to you, no longer limited to plain-text replies.
- **Proactive questions**: when the bot encounters uncertain information, it proactively asks you questions, letting you pick an answer with a single tap for smoother interaction.
- **Action confirmation**: before performing sensitive or critical operations, the bot requests confirmation, which you approve or block via "Allow/Deny" buttons.
- **Session compaction**: new `/compact` command to compress the current session history in one step, preserving context while freeing space — ideal for very long conversations.
- **Preset switching**: new `/preset` command to view or switch the bot's persona/behavior preset.
- **Network latency test**: upgraded `/bot-ping` to return network transport time and plugin processing time, making it easier to diagnose connection latency.

### Improved

- Long-task execution timeout extended to 30 minutes, so complex tasks are no longer interrupted mid-way.
- Direct and group chats now receive more context-appropriate system prompts.
- Failed proactive message pushes automatically fall back to passive replies, reducing "the bot didn't respond" situations.
- Media files such as images are automatically cleaned up after use, avoiding long-term disk usage.

### Fixed

- Fixed the `/stop` command not actually aborting in-progress generation (it was previously a no-op).
- Fixed the registration order of the approval channel, ensuring confirmation requests are captured and handled correctly.

### Documentation

- README updated with the new `/preset` and `/compact` commands, plus QR-code upgrade guidance.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- **QR link**: when the QR code renders incorrectly, you can click the link printed in the terminal to complete scanning in a browser.

### Improved

- Supports auto-saving QR credentials on Windows (previously failed due to path issues).
- When auto-saving credentials fails, it now clearly guides manual configuration instead of silently dropping existing config.

### Documentation

- Added QR-code screenshots and upgrade guidance.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- **File understanding**: send a file to the bot and it will automatically download and understand its contents, supporting extract, read, analyze, and more.
- **Streaming replies**: replies are displayed incrementally in real time, no need to wait for full generation — a smoother, more natural experience.
- **Visible progress**: when the bot runs tasks (running commands, reading/writing files), you can see what it is doing — no longer a "black box".
- **Error feedback**: when a task ends abnormally, the bot clearly explains the reason, no more "half replies" or "no response at all".

### Improved

- Correctly displays the speaker's nickname in group chats instead of an unreadable string.
- Automatically clears group chat history after replying to avoid cross-conversation interference.
- Voice messages are recognized and kept as text only, without extra invalid links.
- The bot now "actually gets things done": for requests like "download, extract, install", it executes real tool actions instead of just restating the steps.

### Fixed

- Fixed the bot being unable to read/write files (the working directory was misconfigured).
- Fixed duplicate content and too-few chunks in streaming replies.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- **First release**: QQ bot integrated with an AI assistant, supporting direct and group chats.
- **Model switching**: supports switching between different AI models.
- **Common commands**: built-in help, status query, session management, and more.
- **QR binding**: bind the bot by scanning a QR code on first use, with simple setup.

### Fixed

- Fixed config parsing issues.
